README:

Code changed in files:
1.	src/backend/storage/buffer/freelist.c
2.	src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c
3.	src/backend/storage/buffer/buf_init.c
4.	src/include/storage/buf_internals.h


Changes in buf_internals.h:
•	Added a new attribute “timestamp” to track when the buffer is used
Changes in buf_init.c:
•	In InitBufferPool function initializing timestamp value of each buffer to 0
Changed in bufmgr.c:
•	Declared a new function getMaxTimeStamp1  which returns the maximum time stamp of all buffers to update the recently used buffer’s timestamp to 1+maximum
•	In ReadBuffer_common function if the buffer is found in buffer pool the we update the buffer’s timestamp to maximum timestamp+1 and print the buffer id
Changes in freelist.c:
•	Declared a new function getMaxTimeStamp which returns the maximum time stamp of all buffers to update the recently used buffer’s timestamp to 1+maximum
•	Changes made in StrategyGetBuffer:
1.	The LRU implementation is from line number :332.
2.	To Iterate the buffer pool(NBuffers time) and fetch the least recently used buffer,update its time stamp and return the buffer.
